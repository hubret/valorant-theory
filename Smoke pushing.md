As a rule of thumb, if the smoke's role is to screen and obscure vision for a cross, you can push it. If the smoke's role is to deny entrance and you have no means of combatting it, don't push it.

# As attack
If you have the util to create a gap (get the defense to stop watching the smoke) you can push fast as a group to overpower the site.

Dry pushing a smoke as attack on a site where the defense has smoked defensively should never be attempted. The only places where you can come out will be smoked and will be watched from multiple angles, and the defense has nothing else to do but to watch the smoke.

# As defense
As the defense, pushing an attacker smoke used to smokescreen an entryway to get a safe plant is a good play, since the attackers are usually not concerned with watching the smokescreens.

A really shallow friendly defensive smoke can be used to timing an opponent through a smoke, and then shoot them from behind. However this type of smoke is very bad at actually giving defenders a holding advantage.
