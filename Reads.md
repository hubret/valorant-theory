A read is an educated guess on the behaviour of your opponent. A "soft" read is made based on tells (util, footsteps, gunshots, dropped items, etc.), while a hard read is more intuitive and based on the understanding of the opponents habits, or by blind baiting/feigning an action.

Usually, a hard read will be a high risk and high reward opportunity. Predicting that this one guy will rotate though mid and you can sneak there early to ambush them will either end up in a free pick, or you will be very out of position.
