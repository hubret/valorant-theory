# One corner problem
The one corner problem is the simplest type of duel/contest of territory. Two parties are at a standoff on two sides of a corner of a building for example.

The advantage depends on how both parties play the angle.

In this example, red team is pushing around a contested angle. Green is attempting to hold the angle.

## Geometry of the angle/slow swing
If red team is walking towards the corner and starts to round it, but they are closer to the corner than green team, green will see the shoulder of red first. This is because the player model is wider than the player camera's "eye". In real life you can imagine that a person is standing behind a pole in a way that they can't see you but you can see them. It's the same thing.

If red has the geometry advantage, they can round the corner extremely slowly to spot the green team's shoulder before they are seen.

## Possible locations
If red team rounds the corner, the green team only needs to look at the corner where the red team will show up, while the red team will need to clear all possible spots that the green team can be holding the angle from.

## Peekers advantage
If red team already knows the position (in a 1v1) that the green team is watching from, they do not need to react. They just need to prefire right as they move to the spot where both parties see each other. Red team having control of the timing of the engagement means that green team has to use their reaction time to shoot back. If red team has perfect timing, they can have around 400-600ms of a window before fire is returned.

## Wide swing
If red team knows that green team can't hold deep for a geometry advantage, they can swing fast and further than just around the corner, effectively strafe-checking green team.

# Two corner problem
A two corner problem is a contest of an area between two corners. The corners can be opposite (like in a Z shape) or same sided (like a U shape)
