# Ring around the rosie
The ring around the rosie problem is a 1v1 scenario in which both parties
1. do not have active sightlines to each other
2. are separated by an obstacle that blocks vision and
3. the main means of winning is timeout or elimination, if away from the bomb or site with low time.

If you can exploit the opponent's lack of patience, you can try to back away from the obstacle, thereby keeping both sides of the obstacle in a narrower field of view, increasing your chance of a successful flick, if the opponent appears on the side you are not holding. When they push they will be expecting you to be close to the obstacle. This works well with [[Tempo and patience#Tempo|tempo]].

# Double ring around the rosie
This is two obstacles creating a figure 8 track. Generally, neither party should push through the middle between the two obstacles if they are unsure of which side their opponent is on. This is due to being exposed from both ends of the double ring.

Examples of double rings:
- double pyramids/"tits" on Breeze
- screen and elbow on Split A
- garage, window, ct, and c site boxes on Haven C

You can manufacture a ring or double ring using a Sage wall.
