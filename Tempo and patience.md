# Tempo
Tempo revolves around leveraging the advantage of a quick decision. The idea is that an unexpectedly quick decision is better than the objectively right decision. To make a good tempo decision, you should be able to quickly weigh the risk/reward of possible choices, and then execute a good enough plan as soon as possible. It helps if you have good Situational Awareness, or if you go for a [[Reads|Hard Read]], and read correctly.

## Tempo examples
### Tempo clutch
You're in a 1v2 scenario and both enemies going to come from Main, but the first enemy erroneously peeks you alone. You manage to kill the first one, the second one probably slows down to consider the 1v1. You should use tempo to reposition yourself closer or inside Main if you can beat the last enemy there, in order to catch them in transit as you will have the advantage if you use peeker's advantage while they are walking straight at you. Otherwise, if they are too close for you to aggress, you can use tempo to reposition deeper into site to introduce more angles for the enemy to clear.

If you don't tempo, you are stuck in either the same spot you took the last engagement, or stuck mid-transit to your next spot, if you decide to move too late.

### Gain control of an angle
Imagine you are in a [two corner problem](./Corner%20problem.md#Two%20corner%20problem) at mid and the enemy has control of the angle with an Op, you can't peek around your corner. If your teammate flashes the enemy away from their angle, you should exercise quick tempo to gain control over the angle (perhaps at an off angle), and now you would be holding their angle. If you are too slow, they will already be back on the angle, and you could risk peeking into their crosshairs.

### Choose an unlikely position
After planting the bomb, you immediately move to an unlikely waiting position. Sometimes you only have a few split seconds, and this will only be possible with tempo. Otherwise you might be forced to rat on the plant. After the defender(s) come and tap, you can use the [[Mind games and cheese tech#Flinch check|Flinch Check]].

# Patience
The opposite of tempo is patience, which is used tactically a fair bit less, as something like a quick rotation is better than a slow one. The idea is to subvert the enemy's expectations by waiting longer than they expect.

Take the two corner problem:
If you stop giving tells in the area, after a while, the enemy may think you've retreated from the angle. If the enemy on the angle becomes impatient, confident, or lets their guard down, they can start to push your angle while you are still holding it, transforming the area into a [[Corner problem#One corner problem|one corner problem]]. Using good positioning gives you an advantage as the enemy moves into your crosshair.

This scenario is sort of also like a read on a defender who pushes quickly and carelessly upon seeing tells on the opposite part of the map. If your team can be patient and resist giving tells away, you can pick off the aggressing defender by being patient.

# Tempo vs patience
In my experience, the "no mans land" between tempo and patience is where you are most vulnerable. Too slow to gain an advantage, but too hasty to surprise. In a situation where you are in a contest of wits, the aim should always be to try to tempo, as it increases the likelihood of a round win, but if the window to tempo is gone, you may have no choice but to use patience. If the chance of winning the round is slim because you don't tempo, you will probably have less of a chance of winning if you make a decision in no mans land.
