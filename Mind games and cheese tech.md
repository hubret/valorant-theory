# Strafe check
Dueling tactic.

With the spectre, you can enter Run And God Mode. You can challenge riflers by engaging them at really short distances and circle strafing around them, while throwing in some ADADs at them. This will test their ability to track rapid targets and see if they run out of mouse room to keep spinning in circles. Your superior mobility gives you a higher chance of putting 6 into them before they put 4 into you.

# Flinch check
Tactic to prevent the bomb from being defused.

Approach the bomb running on the blind side of the plant. This of course is a bluff, and you hold back just before revealing yourself.

The aim is to telegraph
1. a sudden threat to urge the defuser to draw their weapon.
2. that you are about to all-in into a duel with no reservations, such as trying to wallbang, jiggle, or otherwise trying to play defensively

 This burns time, making the defuser more inclined to stick the bomb the later it is, allowing you to shoot them easier.

 # Last round ratting
 As defense, save the rattiest hiding spots for the last round. The opposing team will be conditioned to think that your team is smart enough to not choose obviously prefireable corners, and will not expect to actually find you there when they lazily check the spot.
